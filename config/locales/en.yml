      domain_explanation_html: "Our « Vivenda » is a small structure including 4 bungalows/houses (what we call the casas): 3 of which can be rented as holiday rentals and 1 which is occupied by ourselves. The bungalows are next to each other and have been built in 2007, on a domain of 1 hectare of nature. <br>
      Our bungalows all have big windows so that you can enjoy the view of the nature and the mountains. <br><br>
      Our domain is the perfect solution for families and/or bigger groups of people. You can rent 1, 2 or 3 casas depending on your needs. <br><br>
      The location of our vivenda is perfect to avoid the bad weather of Northern Europe. All the shops, bars and restaurants are open all year long. <br><br>
      Our 3 bungalows all have the same amenities, but are decorated in different themes. "

      about_us: "About us"
      about_us_description_html: "Belgian couple, both travel agents for 25 years, we decided to leave everything behind and follow our dream of living abroad. Since we both worked in the touristic sector, it followed naturally to continue in this sector. We fell in love with this “Vivenda” in the green heart of Portugal and went for it… <br><br>
      The center of Portugal has many activities for nature lovers, from kayaking on the Mondego, to walking on the Serra da Estrella. Although we are not located near the sea, Portugal has plenty of “Praia fluvia”, river beaches. 
      We fell in love with this part of Portugal and we are convinced that you would feel at home instantly as well. 
      <br><br>So, see you soon we hope? 
      <br><br>Gene & Didier"
