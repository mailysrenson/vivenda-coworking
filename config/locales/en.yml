      about_us: "About us"
      about_us_description_html: "Belgian couple, both travel agents in Belgium for 25 years, we decided to leave everything behind and follow our dream of living abroad in the beginning of 2020. Since we both worked in the touristic sector, it followed naturally to continue in this sector. We fell in love with this 'Vivenda' in the green heart of Portugal and went for it… <br><br>
      The center of Portugal offers many activities for nature lovers, from kayaking on the Mondego, to walking on the Serra da Estrella and simply watching. Although we are not located near the sea, Portugal has plenty of “Praia fluvia”, river beaches. 
      We fell in love with this part of Portugal and we are convinced that you would feel at home instantly as well. 
      <br><br>So, see you soon we hope? 
      <br><br>Gene & Didier"
